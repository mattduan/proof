PROOF (Python Relational Object-Oriented Framework) is a persistent data layer
designed for python.

The purpose of PROOF is to separate the data processing details from apps
domain logic. PROOF is an intermediate layer between domain layers and data
resources like database, files, XML, etc. PROOF converts data resources into
an object-oriented representation and pertains the relationship between these
objects. Data resources and data handling are totally hidden from domain layer.
At the same time, PROOF will provide data source adapters (a separate layer in
PROOF to maintain data drivers), data process effeciency (repository pattern), 
data concurrency (aggregate pattern, unit-of-work pattern) and transaction 
support.
